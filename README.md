# Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN and PyTorch

This project predicts customer churn in credit card services using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with PyTorch. The model was trained on the Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction dataset from Kaggle, achieving an accuracy of 86%.

### Project Overview
Customer churn prediction helps companies identify customers likely to stop using their services, allowing targeted retention strategies. In this project, an ANN model was designed and trained to predict churn based on various customer metrics.
